# Micromouse Maze Simulator

This repository contains resources and documentation for teams participating in the Micromouse Competition as part of the ENCS4380 Interfacing Techniques course. This competition aims for small teams of students to design and build an autonomous robot capable of navigating a maze from a specified corner to the center in the shortest time possible.

## Objective

Design and build an autonomous, self-contained robot that can traverse an unknown maze from a corner to the center in the minimum amount of time.

## Rules for the Micromouse (Robot)

1. **Autonomy**: The robot must be completely autonomous and self-contained, with no external signals allowed once it starts.
2. **Power Source**: No combustion-based energy sources are allowed.
3. **Maze Integrity**: The robot must not damage the maze in any way.
4. **Physical Constraints**: The robot cannot climb, jump, or fly over the maze walls.
5. **Size Limitations**: The robot must be smaller than 20cm x 20cm x 20cm in all dimensions throughout its run.
6. **Cost Limitations**: Total cost must not exceed $200, factoring in both new and donated materials.

## Rules for the Maze

- **Structure**: The maze consists of 16 x 16 unit squares, each 18.2 cm x 18.2 cm, with walls 5 cm high and 1.2 cm thick.
- **Material**: The walls are white, the tops are red, and the floor is black, made of non-gloss painted wood.
- **Start and Finish**: The start is at one of the four corners, and the finish is the central four cells, accessible from one entrance only.
- 
## Competition Rules

- **Time Allocation**: Each robot has 12 minutes of total maze access time, with time measured from exiting the start square to entering the destination square.
- **Run Conditions**: Touching the robot during a run results in an aborted run and a 20-second penalty on the next run.
- **Environment**: Standard ambient conditions apply; do not assume consistent lighting or floor conditions.

## Sample Mazes

Sample mazes are available for download in this repository to help teams prepare for the competition layout.
